    "This notebook demonstrates how to use NLP-based evaluators to assess the quality of generated text by comparing it to reference text. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:\n",
    " - Understand different NLP evaluators such as `BleuScoreEvaluator`, `GleuScoreEvaluator`, `MeteorScoreEvaluator`, and `RougeScoreEvaluator`.\n",
    " - Evaluate dataset using these evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 10 minutes running this notebook.\n",
