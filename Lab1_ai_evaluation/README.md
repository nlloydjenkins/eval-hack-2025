# Evaluate generative AI
## Overview
Evaluations are systematic processes of assessing the performance, reliability, and efficacy of generative AI applications. These assessments involve a series of tests and metrics designed to quantify how well an AI model performs its intended task. The goal is to ensure that the AI application behaves as expected, providing accurate and relevant outputs in various scenarios.
Evaluations are crucial for several reasons:
•	Quality Assurance: They help in ensuring that the AI systems meet the desired standards of accuracy and reliability.
•	Performance Metrics: Evaluations provide essential data on the effectiveness of the AI app’s outputs, highlighting areas for improvement.
•	Bias Detection: They help in identifying and measuring the prevalence of biases present in the AI model, highlighting areas for improvement.
•	User Trust: AI applications that perform consistently well help build trust with users, earning higher satisfaction and usage.

# AI-assisted evaluations with Azure
Evaluating generative AI models presents unique challenges due to their dynamic and often creative outputs. Traditional evaluation methods might not fully capture the intricacies of generative models, necessitating more specialized approaches. As such, we provide AI-assisted evaluations which use machine learning techniques to augment the evaluation process. The choice of models for AI-assisted evaluation can significantly affect the results. Therefore, we recommend testing and comparing your evaluations with the supported GPT 3.5, GPT 4, or GPT4o model for your calculations.
You have the flexibility to run evaluations with Azure either through the UI in Azure AI Foundry or programmatically with the Azure AI Evaluation SDK. Both tools provide access to a series of Performance & Quality and Risk & Safety metrics. However, programmatically, you also can create your own code-based and prompt-based custom evaluators, and also log your custom evaluators to your Azure AI project.

## Prerequisites
**Important:** You must create an **Azure AI Foundry Hub** (not just a project) to use AI-assisted evaluators like `GroundednessProEvaluator`. 

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com)
2. Create a new **Hub** (this provides the full Azure ML workspace infrastructure)
3. Create a **Project** under the Hub
4. Note the Hub's resource group and your project name

Set up environmental variables for Azure OpenAI models deployments and associated keys in the credentials.env:
```
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=""
AZURE_TENANT_ID=""
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=""  ## Resource group where your Hub is located
AZURE_PROJECT_NAME=""     ## Your project name (e.g., "YourProject-Name")

# AI assitant Judge (GPT4o prerferbaly as this most learned and accurate)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=""
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=""

# Model1
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT35_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT35_API_KEY=""

# Model2
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4_API_KEY=""

# Model3
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4o_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4o_API_KEY=""

# Model4
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4o-mini_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_GPT4o-mini_API_KEY=""
```

## Lab
This lab use a AI-assited single aoai model endpoints for evaluation for groundedness in ai_evaluation.ipynb. We use Prompt-based groundedness using your own model deployment to output a score and an explanation for the score is currently supported in all regions.Effectively, the model is behaving as judge
```
Class GroundednessProEvaluator: This is an experimental class, and may change at any time. Please see https://aka.ms/azuremlexperimental for more information.
{'gpt_groundedness': 5.0,
 'groundedness': 5.0,
 'groundedness_reason': 'The response accurately and completely answers the '
                        'query using the information provided in the context.'}
{'groundedness_pro_label': True,
 'groundedness_pro_reason': 'All Contents are grounded'}
```

In addition, we expore multiple aoai models comparative evaluation framework in evaluate_base_model_endpoint.ipynb to understand which model yields accurate results on qualitative metrics. The sample dataset we use in this excercise is ai_data.jsonl.

We have a set of note books for each scenario. Each notebook are independent from each other so you can choose to run
